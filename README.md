👋I'm a second-year Software Engineering student specializing in Full-Stack Web Development. I have hands-on experience and a passion for building fully dynamic, optimized, and well-designed web applications.

Beyond software development, I enjoy traveling 🌍, listening to loud Brazilian Phonk Music 🎧, and training hard in the gym 🏋️‍♂️.

I'm excited about opportunities to leverage my expertise in full-stack web development. Want to reach me? Feel free to email me at majdiboubaker82@gmail.com.
